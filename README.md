Practical Algebraic Calculus Proof Checker 2.0
=================================================

To compile use `./configure.sh` and then `make`.
Furthermore, you need to have installed `gmp` to run `Pacheck 2.0`.

Usage: 
----------------------------------
`./pacheck [ <option> ... ]  [ <input> <proof>] [<target>]`

where `<option>` is one of the following

  `-h | --help            print this command line option summary and exit`  

  `-s | --no-target       only check inferences but not that proof generates target`    

  `-d | --no-delete       ignore delete rules`  

 `-s0                     sort variables according to strcmp(default)`
 `-s1                     sort variables according to -1*strcmp`
 `-s2                     sort variables according to input order`
 `-s3                     sort variables according to reverse input order`


The `<input>` argument should point to a file with the
original set of polynomials and <proof> is a path to a proof file
interpreted as a sequence of inferences in the polynomial calculus.
The tool checks that all inferences in the sequence are correct.

The `<target>` is optional. Ommiting this file has the same effect as choosing option `-s`
It should point to a file with a single polynomial which
should be generated by the proof.
The exit code is zero if and only if all checks succeed.
